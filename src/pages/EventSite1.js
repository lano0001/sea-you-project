          This month SEA YOU is organizing a trash pickup event at the Carcavelos Beach in Lisboa.
          We encourage you to sign up and secure your spot! <br />
          <br />
          We will gather near the train station and walk to the beach together. We have arranged a
          reservation at one of the beach caf√©s after the trash pickup where you will have a chance
          to connect with other people in the SEA YOU family.
